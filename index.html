    <h1>Chess</h1>
    <p><strong>Chess</strong>, one of the oldest and most popular board games, played by <strong>two</strong> opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of contrasting colours, commonly white and black. White moves first, after which the players alternate turns in accordance with fixed rules, each player attempting to force the opponent's principal piece, the <strong>King</strong>, into <strong>checkmate</strong>â€”a position where it is unable to avoid capture.</p>
